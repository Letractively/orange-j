#summary How to use the list tag {somename[]} to iterate over an array or object

= Introduction =

Lists, defined by  are Orange-J's way of iterating over Javascript arrays (and Javascript Objects you want to treat as arrays)


== List Tag Attributes ==
  * *cycleName* _ex:{somename[] cycleName=class odd|even|moreodd}_ 
    * Within the markup of 'somename' the tag {class} will be replaced with 'odd', 'even', or 'moreodd'. It is possible to have as many values separated by '|' as you like. 
    * If the current object has an attribute 'class' it's value will replace the cycleName value.

== the listInc and arrayInc tags ==
These are special tags that work only within lists. They are the list/array index 
the snippet is currently on. 

*Difference between the two* If you pass an object to a template element expecting a list, the 'listInc' will give you the current numeric index (just as if the object were a list)
while 'arrayInc' will give you the actual property name or 'key' for the current index.
